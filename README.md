# Weather Application ![Weather App Logo](./assets/flowchart/favicon.ico)

**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

> **Project Note:** This started off as a school assignment to design & develop our very own weather application by fetching data from `OpenWeatherAPI`. It was the `first major project` in which I was able to implement my newly acquired JavaScript knowledge. I have continued to `refactor the code`, improve the design, and add additional features since then. This was a `desktop first design`, and responsiveness for secondary screen sizes was added later.


## Timeline

| Sprint | Description | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | 1. Design a desktop weather application prototype <br/> 2. Flowchart the logic | `Figma`, `draw.io` | 
| Week 2 | Develop the application based on prototype | `vanilla JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS` |
| *(initial project timeline created pre-week 1)* |
